        <h3>Indonesia food</h3>
        <p class="teks">Indonesian cuisine has a long history although most of it is not well documented, and relied heavily on local practice and oral traditions. 
            A rare instance is demonstrated by Javanese cuisine that somewhat has quite a well-documented culinary tradition. T
            he diversity ranges from ancient bakar batu or stone-grilled yams and boar practiced by Papuan tribes of eastern Indonesia, to sophisticated contemporary Indonesian fusion cuisine.
             The ethnic diversity of Indonesian archipelago provides an eclectic combination mixing local Javanese, Sundanese, Balinese, Minang, 
             Malay and other native cuisine traditions, with centuries worth of foreign contacts with Indian traders, Chinese migrants and Dutch colonials.
             .This is my favorite food and all of these foods are traditional foods that can be found in 
            almost all regions in Indonesia and rendang is the food that I like the most. 
            all these foods from various regions in Indonesia</p>
