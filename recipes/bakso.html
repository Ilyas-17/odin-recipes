    <h1>Bakso</h1>
    <p>Essential comfort food that you can find almost everywhere in Indonesia, from street-vendors to five-star hotels and high-class restaurants, 
        Bakso is brothy meatballs that are usually served with noodles, chili paste, and spring onions. Is that all? No. It’s as versatile as Nasi Goreng. 
        There are many ways to prepare Bakso, but all the variations include meatballs and broth. Originating from the Hokkien word bak-so (肉酥, Pe̍h-ōe-jī: bah-so·), which means "fluffy meat" or "minced meat", this dish has its root in Chinese cuisine.
        Like Nasi Goreng, there is no exact history of when the Indonesians adopted this Chinese recipe of meatball soup as their own.
